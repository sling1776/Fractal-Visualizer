# 0.  From Problem Analysis to Data Definitions
The issue that I have is to refactor this program to be a Program System's Product. I 
am going to be redesigning the basic structure of the files essentially getting rid of 
the two given files and replacing them with 6 other files. 

Prior to Designing it, I will go through the code and ensure that there are no obvious 
errors or ambiguities in the code that need to be removed and won't change the flow of the
program. basically it is just removing nonessential things:

This is the order I removed and changed lines in the files. the file line numbers change as the file changed.

Julia_fractal.py:
    These lines found in the file src/julia_fractal.py at line 41 are overly complex:
    ```
        for key in dictionary:
            if key in dictionary:
                if key == name:
                    value = dictionary[key]
                    return key
    ```
    It can be replaced without changing the meaning of the program to:
    ```
    for key in dictionary:
        if key == name:
            return key
    ```   
    line 26 and 29 in the file src/julia_fractal.py are is unreachable. 
    ```
    z += z + c  
    ...    
    return grad[78]
    ```
    simply removed the lines.
    lines 68-76 are repetitive as well as unused. 
    ```
        canvas.pack()  # This seems repetitive
        canvas.pack()  # But it is how Larry wrote it
        canvas.pack()  # Larry's a smart guy.  I'm sure he has his reasons.
        area_in_pixels = 512 * 512
        canvas.pack()  # Does this even matter?
        # At this scale, how much length and height of the
        # imaginary plane does one pixel cover?
    ```
    simply removed the lines.   
    line 71-72 are repetitive and unused:
    ```
    fraction = int(512 / 64)
    canvas.pack()
    ```
    removed lines
    
mbrot_fractal.py:
    line 48 in mbrot_fractal.py is extra. it never gets reached.
    ```
    return gradient[MAX_ITERATIONS]
    ```
    removed line
    line 64 declares a variable that is never used. 
    ```
    maxy = fractal['centerY'] + (fractal['axisLen'] / 2.0)
    ```
    removed line
    line 75-76 declare variable never used:
    ```
    portion = int(512 / 64)
    total_pixels = 1048576
    ```
    removed lines
    
Dead code and useless code should be removed at this point. 
There are still many other issues with the code that will be changed as needed.

**Design a process for obtaining the output from the input.  Consider both *good*
and *bad* inputs.  Find or create examples of both kinds of input.**

**Work out problem examples on paper, on a whiteboard or some other medium that
is *not* your computer.  It is a mistake to begin writing executable code
before you thoroughly understand what form the algorithm(s) must take.**

**Instead, describe components of the system in *"pseudocode"*.  Expect to make
lots of mistakes at this point.  You will find that it is much easier to throw
away pseudocode than real code.**

**Manually work through several examples that illustrate the program's overall
purpose, as well as the purpose of each component of the finished system.  You
will converge on a correct solution much faster if you feel comfortable making
mistakes as you go.**

**This phase involves the use of many levels of abstraction to decompose the
problem into manageable components, and design strategies for implementing each
component.  Components may be functions, modules or classes.**


# 3.  Function Template

**Combine the function stubs written in step #2 with pseudocode from step #3.
Comment out the pseudocode, leaving a valid program that compiles/runs without
errors.  At this stage your program doesn't quite work, but it also doesn't
crash.**


# 4.  Implementation

**This is the only part of the process focused on writing code in your chosen
programming language.**

**One by one translate passages of pseudocode into valid code.  Fill in the gaps
in the function template.  Exploit the purpose statement and the examples.**

**If you were thorough in the previous steps and are familiar with your
programming system this part will go by very quickly and the code will write
itself.**

**When you are learning a new programming language or an unfamiliar library this
phase can be slow and difficult.  As you gain experience with the relevant
technologies you will spend less and less time in this phase of the process.**


# 5.  Testing

**Articulate the examples given in step #2 as tests and ensure that each
function passes all of its tests.  Doing so discovers mistakes.  Tests also
supplement examples in that they help others read and understand the definition
when the need arisesâ€”and it will arise for any serious program.**

**As bugs are discovered and fixed, devise new test cases that will detect these
problems should they return.**

**If you didn't come across any bugs (lucky you!) think of a possible flaw and a
test that can be employed to screen for it.**

**At a minimum you should create a document explaining step-by-step how a
non-technical user may manually test your program to satisfy themselves that it
operates correctly.  Explain the entire process starting how to launch the
program, what inputs they should give and what results they should see at every
step.  Provide test cases of good and bad inputs to catch both false positives
and false negatives.  Any deviation from the expected outputs are errors.**

**The ideal is to write an automated test to avoid all manual labor beyond
launching the test.**
